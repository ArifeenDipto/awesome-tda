### Other lists

## Tools
### TdaToolbox
[TdaToolbox](https://github.com/Coricos/TdaToolbox)
  - [3DShape] - This notebook gives a simple example of how to handle three-dimensional shapes. The whole example is based on the height as filtration function, so not invariant in space. However, it gives a pretty good idea of what the output of a topological analysis may give.
  - [ToMaTo Clustering] - This notebook rather focus on a specific strength of TDA: its robustness to detect centroids in dataset, along with its ability to record the relationships between each point, enabling us to retrace the whole structure of the centroids. Examples are provided in the notebook.

### TTK
[TTk](https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/index.html) - The Topology ToolKit is an open-source library and software collection for topological data analysis in scientific visualization. TTK can handle scalar data defined either on regular grids or triangulations, either in 2D or in 3D. It provides a substantial collection of generic, efficient and robust implementations of key algorithms in topological data analysis.

For more information you can read ["Topological Data Analysis Made Easy with the Topology ToolKit"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08126.pdf) article.
